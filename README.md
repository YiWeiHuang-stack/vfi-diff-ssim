# vfi-diff-ssim
This is an evaluation algorithm for detecting the frame quality generated by video frame interpolation algorithm

The smaller the value, the higher the quality of the generated frame(same vfi algorithm)

# usage:
im1 -> origin frame i0

interp -> generated frame

im2 -> origin frame i1
